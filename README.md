# Git-DIT
Git dit is an open-source command-line tool designed to graphically display Git's commit history. It uses ASCII characters and simple text formats to draw a history chart of branching, merging, and other Git operations, allowing developers to intuitively understand the project's version control without leaving the terminal.
